# Executive Summary
Humans have always had a good relationship with animals, especially pets. Research results from McConnell et al. (2011) found that having a pet has a good impact on the owner's mental health. However, having a pet is not enough because it requires special care and treatment to keep the pet healthy. Unfortunately, from the results of our research, it was found that there are still many people who feel lacking and need more information about good and correct pet care. They normally only looked for information through articles or word of mouth among fellow pet owners. Moreover, there is no special platform for interaction between animal owners, such as exchanging information on how to care for and adopt a pet. For this reason, we have an idea to create a platform that can help owners take good care of their pets, namely through the HEYPET. This application is a solution to these problems, such as an AI feature that provides pet care information based on Image Classification. HEYPET also provides a forum to interact, share information with other pet owners and can find pets for adoption. This app also provides a reminder feature to help pet owners remember their pet grooming schedule. So, we expect this application can help pet owners take care of their pets become easier and fun.
